    <!-- Units and Sizes in CSS -->

<p class="head">Units and Sizes</p>
<p>There are two types of units, absolute and relative.</p>
<p>Absolute units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.</p>
<p>Relative units are relative to another length value. For example, a length expressed in ems will appear as the given length multiplied by the font size.</p>

<p id="bold">There are two types of absolute units:</p>
<ul>
  <li>px - stands for pixels</li>
  <li>cm - stands for centimeters</li>
</ul>

<p id="bold">There are four types of relative units:</p>
<ul>
  <li>em - Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)</li>
  <li>rem - Relative to font-size of the root element</li>
  <li>% - Relative to the parent element</li>
  <li>vw - Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*</li>
  <li>vh - Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*</li>
  <li>vmin - Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension</li>
  <li>vmax - Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension</li>
</ul>
